# R16S REV.B SDK

This SDK is forked from [asr_lora_6601](https://github.com/asrlora/asr_lora_6601.git),  and modified for R16S REV.B LoRa module.

R16S REV.B is a LPWAN wireless communication module designed with ASR6601CB, provides ultralong range and ultra-low power communication for LPWAN application.

ASR6601CB is a general LPWAN Wireless Communication SoC, with integrated RF Transceiver, Modem and a 32-bit RISC MCU. The RF Transceiver has continuous frequency coverage from 150 MHz to 960 MHz. The Modem supports LoRa modulation for LPWAN use cases and (G)FSK modulation for legacy use cases. The Modem also supports BPSK modulation in TX and (G)MSK modulation in TX and RX. 

R16S can achieve a high sensitivity to -148 dBm and the maximum transmit power is up to +22 dBm. This makes the module suitable to be used in long range LPWAN and have high efficiency.
